# Simple CORS Server

## Installation
1. ```npm install simple-cors-server -g```

## Usage
1. cd to the path of your project
1. ```simplecors```

You can also optionally specify a port to run on (you need to specify this if you get EACCES errors, which means you have another server running on that port):

```simplecors 9000```
